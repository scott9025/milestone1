For the project, I am thinking about exploring the relationship between the COVID-19 death rate and the air pollution level. My initial expectation is that the two variables would have a positive correlation. Similar study had already been conducted in Northern Italy in which the study found a positive correlation between the two. Thus, I would like to focus on other countries such as US or China. Dataverse has some nice data on both the Covid cases and the air pollution level in China. I would continue to search data for other countries since I haven't decided on which country I want to focus on.
